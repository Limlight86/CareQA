I recieved a challenge for a UI Position for CareCloud, this was the challenge I recieved, to build a question / answer bank with notficiation pop ups that would reveal the Answer.

I decided to rebuild it using hooks and create-react-app as opposed to the single page older syntax way that the challenge site wanted me to do (I did that one too but felt that I could challenge myself further by doing it with the way I learned how to write React code).

This version is an upgrade from the actual challenge, it is actually better functionality-wise, you can check each items answer individually. The challenge was more about passing tests and not about making a fully working app, it was hard for me in the challenge UI due to the fact that I couldnt boot up my local server to see my app take shape, I need that visual to create UI elements and see them in action.
