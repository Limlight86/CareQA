I recieved a challenge for a UI Position for CareCloud, this was the challenge I recieved, to build a question / answer bank with notficiation pop ups that would reveal the Answer.

I decided to rebuild it using hook and create-react-app as opposed to the single page old school way that the challenge site wanted me to do (I did that one too but didnt like it).

This version is an upgrade from the actual challenge, it is actually better functionality-wise, you can check each items answer individually. The challenge was more about passing tests and not about making a fully working app, I didnt even like the fact that I couldnt boot up my local server to see my app take shape, I need that visual to create UI elements.
